These Matlab codes are example codes for a preprocessing pipeline for EEG data, using combinations of EEGLAB, Fieldtrip and ERPlab. The pdf provided alongside the code is an extensive manual explaining the different steps, the caveats, and the rationale behind certain settings.

Please note that there is no unique, correct way of preprocessing EEG data. The steps presented are a result of roughly 5 years of (personal and collaborative) experience.

Please read the pdf manual carefully before running the code.
